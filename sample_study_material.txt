Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. Key tasks include tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units like words or subwords. Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies entities like names, places, and organizations.

Computer Vision (CV) is a field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects - and then react to what they see. Common tasks include object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Object detection involves locating and identifying objects within an image.
